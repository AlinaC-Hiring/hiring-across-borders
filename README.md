# hiring-across-borders
A list of companies that are able to hire Americans looking to emigrate. 

Over the last few weeks, I’ve talked to more and more American tech workers who are curious about moving abroad. In an attempt to be helpful, I’m putting together a list of companies that are able to support new employees immigrating. This means that **these companies are able to help new employees get visas or work permits, either by “sponsorship” or simply by assisting with necessary paperwork**.

The easiest way to view the data is to see it on the rendered page: http://bit.ly/hiring-across-borders 

### Contributing 
The easiest way to add your company to the list is to open a PR on this repo and update [the data file](/_data/companies.yml). If you're not comfortable with that, you can also send me a DM or email.
